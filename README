-About: 
-
-RTL is a web-based online game like OGAME and others. It attemps to use tabs and
-standard objects from HTML as the game menus. As in these genre of games almost 80% of
-all stuff is managed from windows, tabs, grids and tables, it looked to me to most easy part to develop.
-
-
-Goals:
-
- - All content fits in a whole web window, so you can play as you used in Ogame's likes...
- - Free to Play. Could make it profit by supporting ad banners at the top of the game..
- - Beautiful hand drawn graphics for characters, items, etc...
- - Fast change between inventory and options using tabs in the main browser...
- - User-driven market. Let users to auction and make some economy flow..
- - Online Radio from Shoutcast, Spotify & Grooveshark. Let users listen to whatever they want...
- - HTML5 to eventually support 2D or 3D smooth graphics...
- - Animation and effects of the GUI using JqueryUI, etc...
- - Finish a bloody rpg at last (This idea came from summer'97..)
